I followed a Youtube Tutorial Series titled "30 Days Of Java" to learn about Java, but I abandoned the series on July 18th, 2020, just before I started High School. I am unable to find the specific series in which I followed the tutorial, so if you're reading this, please let me know if you do so that I can give proper credit.


Collections Script: Hashmap practice with putting in names into hashmap and then printing out all of them

MazeSolver Script: Creates a maze, with walls, and then solves it from beginnning to destination

MySweetProgram Script: Prints out a double array (I wonder if I didn't abandon the Series here because it looks unfinished?)
